Azure App Service Plan -

An App Service plan is the container for your app. The App Service plan settings will determine the location, features, cost and compute resources associated with your app.

Each app is hosted on App service
Each app service is in some App service plan
Multiple app services can map single app service plan
App service plan defines neccessary compute, storage and network just same as VM
We can Scale Up, Sclae IN or Scale Out app service plan as per requirement and usage

Create App service Plan -> set Valid name -> location -> select price tier where we select compute

App service can host different types of application - .net core, ASP.NET web, API, Mobile, Node
We can create a app service using azure cli or powershell
to create a web app we need resource group, app service plan name and webapp name


To push in git
git init
git remote add
git push



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployement Slot

Allow diffrent version of your web app with diffrent URL 
allow us to validate the application on azure infra before deploying to customer infra
We can deploy diffrent versions by adding slots yo your app service plan by CLI or by Portal
Minimize downtime
Created in same resource and same app service plan No additional Play

Go to web app ->  select Application setting -> set key value -> tick slot
select deployement slots -> add slot -> give name -> finish
Goto Slot -> Application settings -> change as per your requirement
You will get clone URL
Push this webapp to git usingclone URL

From portal click swap button to change from one slot to other

Monitoring -
- Monotors CPU Usage, Data In , Data Out , Disk Usage, Memory Perventage

From Left Pane (Resorces) -> Select Monitor -> select Matrix -> select your app service plan

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alerts - 
You can set Alerts for unusual activities in your app service
-> we can configure to send email, SMS or phone call

Activity Log alert - operational activities
Metric Log alert - web traffic, CPU utilization

For Application Error Alerts -> Go To Metric Log Alert -> Add rule -> Select Event source and Condition 
-> you can add email or specify web hook or add logic app

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scalling -
We can scale by
Scale Up (vertical)    - moving to diffrent price tier of compute -> means increasing CPU proccessing, memory,disk
Scale Out (horizontal) - increasing instance count (prefered)
Sclae In               - Reducing Instance Count 

We can enable autoscalling by setting scalling rule for Scale In condition and Scale Out condition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debuging 
select App Service Plan -> Diagnostic logs -> set parameters for application logs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application Insight 
- detect & diagnose issues in your web app
- Remote debugging Tools

Used for 
Find and diagnose run-time exceptions
Find and diagnose performance issues
Monitor and alert on application health
Analyze customer usage and information

To Create Application Insights
-> Create Application Insight Resource from portal
Go To project in VS -> right click and select apllication Insight Telementory option
-> select Application insight resource -> register
