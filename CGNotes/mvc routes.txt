In ASP.NET Core MVC, Routing is the system by which URLs get mapped to controller actions and other resources. 
There are two primary methods of creating routes: 
convention-based routing, which defines a few routes in the Startup.cs file
attribute routing, which defines a route per action.

route handlers class which do the actual mapping.

There are two main ways to define routes:

Convention-based routing creates routes based on a series of conventions, defined in the ASP.NET Core Startup.cs file.
Attribute routing creates routes based on attributes placed on controller actions.
The two routing systems can co-exist in the same system.

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
    ...
    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapRoute(
            template: "{controller}/{action}");
    });
}
